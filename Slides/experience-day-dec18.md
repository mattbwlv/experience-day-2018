> I use the term nonlinear to refer to the fact that games provide many choices for players to make, and that every gameplay will be different. Nonlinearity serves several functions in games by providing players with reasons to replay a game in a new order, thereby facing new challenges, for example, as well as to grant users a sense of agency and freedom.
